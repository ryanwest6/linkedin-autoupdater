# Resume Dump

This is a dump of all the data that goes into my resume, LinkedIn, and other online job profiles. I've written tools that automatically update all of these sites whenever I change information here.

Whenever I want to update my resume, I have to manually do so in several places - my LinkedIn, the resume itself, and my [Personal Website](https://ryan-west.com). This is very annoying, so I've built a tool that will pull data from one place and automatically update all of my sites with the new information.
